/** Represents a state in the game's state machine, providing a base class for different game states.
 * This class forms part of the State design pattern, where it encapsulates the behavior associated
 * with a specific state of the [[GameController]].
 *
 * Upon instantiation, [[GameState]] automatically sets itself as the current state in the provided
 * [[GameController]] context. This class provides a skeletal implementation for game states, including
 * methods for performing actions and transitioning to other states. The specific behaviors and transitions
 * are meant to be defined in subclasses representing concrete states of the game.
 *
 * @constructor Initializes a new game state and sets it as the current state in the provided GameController context.
 * @param context The GameController that this state is associated with.
